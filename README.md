CP Menu Master
==============

Take control of your control panel menus! CP Menu Master allows you to hide channels from the
publish menu for ALL users, show channels as a sub-menu in the edit menu, and even display
control panel menus on mouse-over instead of click. Think of all those seconds you will save!

Please note: This accessory does not enforce any kind of security to prevent users publishing
to channels. It simply removes links from the publish menu, to reduce clutter. Smart users
can still publish to those channels by accessing the correct URL.
